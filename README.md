# SQL Chat with LangChain

This project is a simple chat application built using SQL for data storage and language chaining for conversation generation.
Overview

The SQL Chat with LangChain project combines the power of SQL databases for storing chat data with language chaining techniques for generating conversational responses. Users can interact with the chatbot, and the system will store the conversations in an SQL database for future analysis and improvement of the chatbot's responses.
Features

    SQL Database: Conversations are stored in an SQL database for easy retrieval and analysis.
    Language Chaining: The chatbot utilizes language chaining techniques to generate contextually relevant responses based on the conversation history.
